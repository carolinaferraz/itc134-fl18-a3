Once upon a time, a spaceship landed on a distant planet. It was a in a galaxy very far away and the three occupants of the ship did not know where they were. 

Suddenly, they saw a bunch of flying monkey from afar flying to where they were standing. The flying monkeys surrounded the girl in their group, Carolina. They grabbed her to the sky and disappeared quickly after that. 
Luckily for Carolina, her jetpack was still working and had plenty of fuel and she was able to fight off the monkeys and land safely back where she was able to contact a nearby base to report what happened and ask for help. She was able to reach Captain Armstrong from the Muscle Planet.

The other two guys, Tom and Jerry then said: "Let's leave quickly. It's so dangerous." They started their spaceship and left quickly.

The next day, Captain Armstrong arrives at Carolina's planet alone. She was surprised since she did not expect help would come to her that fast. Little did she knows, standing in front of her is a master of evil evil plans....
