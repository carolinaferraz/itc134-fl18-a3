Once upon a time, a spaceship landed on a distant planet. It was a in a galaxy very far away and the three occupants of the ship did not know where they were. 
Suddenly, they saw a bunch of flying monkey from a far flying to where they are standing. The flying monkey surrounded the girl, Carolina, in their group. They grabbed her to the sky and disappeared quickly after that.
