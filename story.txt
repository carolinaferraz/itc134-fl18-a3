Once upon a time, a spaceship landed on a distant planet. It was a in a galaxy very far away and the three occupants of the ship did not know where they were. 
Suddenly, they saw a bunch of flying monkey from a far flying to where they are standing. The flying monkey surrounded the girl, Carolina, in their group. They grabbed her to the sky and disappeared quickly after that. 
The other two guys, Tom and Jerry then said: "Let's leave quickly. It's so dangerous." They started their spaceship and left quickly.
